Notes on Lecture 1 of CS50
<!--more-->

- [C](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#c)

    ```c
    **#include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    }**
    ```

    - #include <stdio.h> = when you want to use a function, you tell the computer where the function is saved
    - int main(void) = beginning of the code to start things when you click 'run'
    - use curly brackets to write your code
- [hello, world](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#hello-world)
    - [https://sandbox.cs50.io/](https://sandbox.cs50.io/)
    - end the C file with .c
- [Compilers](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#compilers)
    - source input is the source code we write the instructions with a programming language, in this case C.
    - The computer operates on binary, therefore the source code needs to be converted to machine code through a COMPILER

        ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9afaccef-9961-4cf4-a53d-bd9c58900104/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9afaccef-9961-4cf4-a53d-bd9c58900104/Untitled.png)

    - compiler = a software that converts source code to machine code
        - clang = c language
    - To convert source code to binary code use the terminal
        - This is the binary code created by the compiler

        type in terminal: **`$ clang hello.c`  it will create a.out = assembly output**

    - To use this machine code:
        - type in terminal  ./a.out
            - This is telling the computer to run this file
            - the . in the beginning tells the computer to run the program (called a.out) in the CURRENT folder

- [Strings and useful commands](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#string)
    - to remove the dollar sign at the end of the word and move to the next line, add `\n` at the end of the text (before the ")
    - need to run the compiler again to update the binary output
    - can change the name of our program from a.out to something else, too
        - pass **command-line arguments**, or additional options, to programs in the terminal
        - type `clang -o hello hello.c`, and `-o hello` is telling the program clang to save the compiled output as just hello. Then, we can just run `./hello`.
    - can list the files in the current folder `ls`

        ```c
        $ ls
        a.out* hello* hello.c
        ```

        The asterisk, *, indicates that those files are executable, or that they can be run by our computer.

    - We can use the `rm` (remove) command to delete a file:

        ```c
        $ rm a.out
        rm: remove regular file 'a.out'?
        ```

        - We can type `y` or `yes` to confirm, and use `ls` again to see that it’s gone
- [Scratch blocks in C](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#scratch-blocks-in-c)
    - Increments
        - “set count to 0” block is creating a variable, and in C we would write `int counter = 0`;, where int specifies that the type of our variable is an integer
        - “increase count by 1” is `counter = counter + 1`; in C.
            - In C, the = isn’t like an equals sign in a equation, where we are saying counter is the same as counter + 1. Instead, = is an assignment operator that means, “copy the value on the right, into the value on the left”.
            - we don’t need to say int anymore, since we presume that we already specified previously that counter is an int, with some existing value.
            - We can also say `counter += 1`; or `counter++`; both of which are “syntactic sugar”, or shortcuts that have the same effect with fewer characters to type.
    - Conditions

        ```c
        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }

        //If Else conditions:

        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("x is not less than y\n");
        }

        //Else if conditions:

        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        else if (x > y)
        {
            printf("x is greater than y\n");
        }
        else if (x == y)
        {
            printf("x is equal to y\n");
        }
        ```

        Lines of code that themselves are not some action (if..., and the braces) don’t end in a semicolon.

        - Notice that, to compare two values in C, we use `==`, two equals signs.
        - And, logically, we don’t need the `if (x == y)` in the final condition, since that’s the only case remaining, and we can just say `else`.
    - Loops
        - The `while` keyword also requires a condition, so we use true as the Boolean expression to ensure that our loop will run **forever.** Our program will check whether the expression evaluates to true (which it always will in this case), and then run the lines inside the curly braces. Then it will repeat that until the expression isn’t true anymore (which won’t change in this case).

            ```c
            while (true)
            {
                printf("hello, world\n");
            }

            //To create a loop for a certain count:

            int i = 0;
            while (i < 50)
            {
                printf("hello, world\n");
                i++;
            }
            ```

        - To do the same repetition, more commonly we can use the `for` keyword:

            ```c
            **for** (**int** i **=** 0; i **<** 50; i**++**)
            { printf("hello, world\n");

            ```

            - create a variable named `i` and set it to 0.
            - check that `i < 50` every time we reach the top of the loop, before we run any of the code inside
            - If that expression is true, then we run the code inside.
            - after we run the code inside, we use `i++` to add one to `i`, and the loop repeats.
- [Types, formats, operators](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#types-formats-operators)
    - There are other types we can use for our variables
        - `bool`, a Boolean expression of either `true` or `false`
        - `char`, a single character like `a` or `2`
        - `double`, a floating-point value with even more digits
        - `float`, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
        - `int`, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
        - `long`, integers with more bits, so they can count higher
        - `string`, a string of characters
    - And the CS50 library has corresponding functions to get input of various types:
        - `get_char`
        - `get_double`
        - `get_float`
        - `get_int`
        - `get_long`
        - `get_string`
    - For `printf`, too, there are different placeholders for each type:
        - `%c` for chars
        - `%f` for floats, doubles
        - `%i` for ints
        - `%li` for longs
        - `%s` for strings
    - And there are some mathematical operators we can use:
        - `+` for addition
        - `-` for subtraction
        - `*` for multiplication
        - `/` for division
        - `%` for remainder
    - Quotations when printing:
        - single codes are necessary for characters (chars) - indicates literal character
        - double quotes needed for strings - indicates multiple characters
    - casting- converting one data type into another
        - e.g. converting a character into an integer:
            - `printf("%i %i %i\n", c1, c2, c3)`
            - `printf("%i %i %i\n", (int) c1, (int) c2, (int) c3)`
- [More examples](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#more-examples)
    - [Screens](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#screens)
    - Check if  a number is odd or even:
        - divide it by 2, and if there is a remainder of nil, it's even, otherwise it's odd:

            ```c
            #include <cs50.h>
            #include <stdio.h>

            int main(void)
            {
                int n = get_int("n: ");

                if (n % 2 == 0)
                {
                    printf("even\n");
                }
                else
                {
                    printf("odd\n");
                }
            }
            ```

- [Memory, imprecision, and overflow](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/#memory-imprecision-and-overflow)
    - Our computer has memory, in hardware chips called RAM, random-access memory. Our programs use that RAM to store data as they run, but that memory is finite. So with a finite number of bits, we can’t represent all possible numbers (of which there are an infinite number of). So our computer has a certain number of bits for each float and int, and has to round to the nearest decimal value at a certain point.
    - The Y2K problem arose because many programs stored the calendar year with just two digits, like 98 for 1998, and 99 for 1999. But when the year 2000 approached, the programs would have stored 00, leading to confusion between the years 1900 and 2000.
    - A Boeing 787 airplane also had a bug where a counter in the generator overflows after a certain number of days of continuous operation, since the number of seconds it has been running could no longer be stored in that counter.
