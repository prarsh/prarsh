## **Lecture 0**

I have no computer science knowledge so have started Harvard's CS50 course as an introduction. These are notes on what I came across/learnt.

- [What is computer science?](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#what-is-computer-science)
    - Problem solving
        - taking some input, generating the output - with a black box in the middle. The black box in the middle is computer science

        - the input to put into a computer needs to be a standard format so that it can be stored and worked with effectively - BINARY
- [Binary](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#binary)
    - the language computers speak, and how they represent information
    - computer stores data in binary - numerical system where there are just two digits 0, 1
    - we count in powers of 10 - we have 10 separate digits (0 to 9) which we use with different column placement to represent the power of 10 for that number
        - The `3` is in the ones column, the `2` is in the tens column, and the `1` is in the hundreds column.
        - So `123` is 100×1 + 10×2 + 1×3 = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123.
        - Each place for a digit represents a power of ten, since there are ten possible digits for each place.
    - a computer counts in powers of TWO ( just two digits = 1, 0)

         **so each column in binary represent a power of 2**

        ```jsx
        2^0 = 1
        2^1 = 2
        2^2 = 4
        2^3 = 8
        and so on;
        so columns represent values of:
        ... 8 4 2 1

        where binary value is
        0011 = (0*8)+(0*4)+(1*2)+(1*1) = 3
        0100 = 4
        0111 = 0+4+2+1 = 7
        1011 = 8+0+2+1 = 13

        ```

    - In a computer, there are millions or billions of transistors that can store electricity and represent a bit by being “on” or “off”.
        - transistor = tiny switch that represents a digit/value, imagine those switches in place of the columns discussed above to get to 13 - lights would be switched on where there is '1'
    - Each column digit is ONE BIT; 8 bits make up one **BYTE**

- [Representing data](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#representing-data)
    - Binary is all number 0 and 1, so how do we translate this to various other data such as words/images/colours etc?
        - Standard mapping: [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) American Standard Code for Information Interchange
            - e.g. A = 65 = 010000001
                - B = 66, C = 67 etc.
    - To see a picture, each pixel has to have a numbers for the level of red, blue, green in that pixel, which makes up the eventual colours and overall picture
- [Algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#algorithms)
    - step by step instructions

        functions = actions

        conditions = 'if'

        booleans = true/false answers

        loops = repeat parts of the program/algorithm
