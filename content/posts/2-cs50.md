Notes on Lecture 2 of CS50

- [Compiling](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/#compiling)
    - stdio.h
        - header file/library
        - has the prototype so that 'clang' knows what it means
        - so thats why you have to specify this in the beginning of your program
        - Clang =
            - We write our source code in C, but need to compile it to machine code, in binary, before our computers can run it.
            - `clang` is the compiler, and `make` is a utility that helps us run `clang` without having to indicate all the options manually.
    - Compiling is made up of the following steps:
        - Preprocessing
            - involves looking at lines that start with # - headers - which tells clang to look out for that file first, since it contains the content we want to include in our program
        - Compiling
            - converts the actual source code (in this case, C), and converts it to assembly code - which looks even more random than the programming language itself
            - the instructions are lower level and closer to binary that a computer's CPU can directly understand
                - they generally operate on bytes themselves, as opposed to abstractions like variable names
        - Assembling
            - takes the assembly code and translates to instructions in binary - that which can be run directly by the CPU
        - Linking
            - contents of previously compiled libraries (like cs50.c) are combined with the binary of our program
            - that's how we end up with one binary file (like a.out) - which combines all libraries we used to one output file
- [Debugging](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/#debugging)
    - run `help50` {name of command you are trying to run}
        - when you have an issue compiling the code
    - [debug50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/#debug50) - in CS50 IDE
        - should be first instinct when something is going wrong
        - when you execute a program with ./a.out - add debug 50 in the front:
            - `$ debug50 ./a.out`
        - it will show you how the code is being executed line by line with the variables used.
    - [check50 and style50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/#check50-and-style50)]
- [Memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/#memory)
    - Inside our computers, we have chips called RAM, random-access memory, that stores data for short-term use. We might save a program or file to our hard drive (or SSD) for long-term storage, but when we open it, it gets copied to RAM first. Though RAM is much smaller, and temporary (until the power is turned off), it is much faster.
- [Arrays](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/#arrays)
    - used for storing variables back to back
        - for example, store different characters as c1, c2, c3, and then you can print these characters by referring to which items in the array
        - numbers stored in an array are always in square brackets [ ]
    - CHAR - SINGLE QUOTES; STRING - DOUBLE QUOTES
        - remember characters are just single numbers in machine code, so you can actually print the number values if you write `printf("%i %i %i\n", c1, c2, c2)` instead of printf("%c %c %c \n", c1, c2, c3)
    - NOTATION of code-
        - state the arrat as `type name [no of items]`
        - FUNCTION("what type of thing you want to print abbreviated for e.g. an integer or string would be %i or %s,  state name of the variables stored e.g. c1 or name )
    - arrays are zero indexed
        - first element of value has index 0
    - the length of an array - `const` keyword
        - the number of variables you want to store may change, so you can add in a 'constant'
            - this indicates to the computer that it will be the same value wherever stated
            - the declaration of the variable will be outside of the `main` function, and will need to be capitalised
                - this isnt necessary for the compiler but easier for us to read that the variable is constant and makes it easy to spot from the start
            - example of this:

            ```c
            #include <cs50.h>
            #include <stdio.h>

            //call the length of the array N
            const int N = 3;

            int main(void)
            {
                // Scores
                int scores[N];
                scores[0] = 72;
                scores[1] = 73;
                scores[2] = 33;

                // Print average
                printf("Average: %i\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / N);
            }
            ```

    - Loops and Arrays
        - we can collect data in a loop
            - a loop has three parts to its notation:
                - ( what value you want to start off with - usually this is 0, how long you want to continue the loop for, how much you want to continually add for)
                    - `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`
            - full notation:

                ```c
                #include <cs50.h>
                #include <stdio.h>

                float average(int length, int array[]);

                int main(void)
                {
                    // ask the user for the number of scores and store this as 'n'
                    int n = get_int("Scores:  ");

                    // get the actual scores, using a loop ensure that the computer only asks for n number of scores
                    int scores[n];
                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                    {
                        // note that the i + 1 at the end ensures that the computer starts with 'Score 1' instead of Score 0
                				scores[i] = get_int("Score %i: ", i + 1);
                    }

                    // Print average - the %.1f is to round it to one decimal place
                    printf("Average: %.1f\n", average(n, scores));
                }

                /* to calculate the average (which is a float value), which was stated at the top of the code before the main function
                you need to have the length of the array and the actual numbers in the array (shown by the square brackets) */
                float average(int length, int array[])
                {
                    int sum = 0;
                    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
                    {
                        sum += array[i];
                    }
                    return (float) sum / (float) length;
                }
                ```

    - Functions
        - note that in the above code we declared the function right at the top but only specified the code at the bottom
            - this helps with readability and organisation, to break down the code into sub-parts
        - FUNCTION DECLARATIONS
            - `return-type name (argument-lists)`
                - return -type
                    - what kind of variable the function will output - string/integer etc
                - name
                    - what you call your function
                - argument-list
                    - is the comma separated set of inputs into your function, each of which has a type and a name
            - e.g. `int add_two_ints (int a, int b);`
        - FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
            - the declaration of the function at the top will be almost identical to the function definition, with a small change
                - basically instead of a semi colon at the end, you use curly braces to define the function next instead

            ```c
            int add_two_ints (int a, int b)
            { 
            		int sum = a + b; //define what you want to do - sum - and then specify what values to use for this, this will be asked for in the main bit with a printf function and asked from the user
            		return sum //show what to return as output
            }
            ```

- [Strings](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/#strings)
    - a string ends with a special character - '\0'
        - it's called the null character, or null terminating character
